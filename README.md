# boneZone
Bone Zone: 
First Fracture (GDevelop 5 platformer test)

INSTRUCTIONS: 
The art files are mixed in with the project files, so I might move them to their own asset folder
This change in directories may cause errors in GDevelop when trying to pull content of a sprite.

If the files are in a folder labeled 'assets', extract the files into the main bonezone directory with the rest of the program files

The most important files are the game.json and autosave.json files. These contain all of arguements of the game.
When in doubt, find these files and build from there.
