# boneZone
Bone Zone: First Fracture (GDevelop 5 platformer test)

INSTRUCTIONS:
The art files are mixed in with the project files, so I might move them to their own asset folder
This change in directories may cause errors in GDevelop when trying to pull content of a sprite.

If the files are in a folder labeled 'assets', extract the files into the main bonezone directory with the rest of the program files
